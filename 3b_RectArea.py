# Define the dimensions of the rectangle
length = 5
width = 10

# Calculate the area using the multiplication operator
area = length * width

# Print the result
print("The area of the rectangle is:", area)


'''
When you run this script, it will output:
The area of the rectangle is: 50
This script defines the length and width variables, calculates the area by multiplying these two values, and then prints the result.
