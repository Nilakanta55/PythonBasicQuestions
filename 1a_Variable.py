"""
In Python, variables are used to store data that can be referenced and manipulated throughout your program. 
Here’s a breakdown to help you understand them better:
"""

# What is a Variable?
"""
A variable in Python is a symbolic name that is a reference or pointer to an object. 
Once an object is assigned to a variable, you can refer to the object by that name.
"""

# Creating Variables

You create a variable by assigning a value to it using the equals sign (=):

# Python
x = 5
name = "Nilakanta"
is_active = True

# In this example:
x is an integer variable.
name is a string variable.
is_active is a boolean variable.


# Variable Naming Rules
1.	Must start with a letter or an underscore (_).
2.	Can only contain letters, numbers, and underscores.
3.	Case-sensitive (e.g., age and Age are different variables).
4.	Cannot use Python reserved keywords (e.g., class, for, if).

# Types of Variables
Python is dynamically typed, meaning you don’t need to declare the type of a variable. The type is inferred from the value assigned to it. Here are some common types:
•	Integer: x = 10
•	Float: pi = 3.14
•	String: greeting = "Hello"
•	Boolean: is_valid = False
•	List: numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
•	Dictionary: person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}
